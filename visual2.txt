The first line instantiates
a world object, distributes 
leaves conically around 
what I addressed as tree,
some rigidish cylinder.       rigidish is awkward—rigid better in my book
Some cried for rain.
In stranger suburbs
I cried with joy when         cried with repeats too strongly perhaps line 6—shouted?
everything went silhouette,
everything mannequin.         (not sure that the move from silhouette to mannequein feels earned, here—rep of everything not enough)
I was standing outside
an inside, maybe I saw
illuminated a square pane
within, a television set     
to stun, maybe a floor lamp    
to glow with sympathy.        I love this sentence but not so much the last line--could be less expected


the final stanza doesn't seem to fully fit, to me—though I like much of the writing. Perhaps a different section?

The sun a primitive solid,
the bounding sphere 
delights an individual flower
either green or yellow or
green and yellow both.     
As purple and orange wait         lines 26-30 are weaker for me—I'm interested in the yellow/green bit but the other colors intrude and feel less motivated.... there's something to salvage in the final lines but again the tone isn't quite right yet, for me.
to emerge the distinction
between them and gray
significant values were
parameters passed to us
when we were called 
by whom for what to where 
we did return, while within
father made a glass painting 
stage set, whatever shards 
reassembled resembled.
