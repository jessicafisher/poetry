The first line instantiates
a world object, distributes 
leaves conically around 
what I addressed as tree,
some rigidish cylinder.
Some cried for rain.
In stranger suburbs
I cried with joy when
everything went silhouette,
everything mannequin.
I was standing outside
an inside, maybe I saw
illuminated a square pane
within, a television set     
to stun, maybe a floor lamp    
to glow with sympathy.

The sun a primitive solid,
the bounding sphere 
delights an individual flower
either green or yellow or
green and yellow both.     
As purple and orange wait
to emerge the distinction
between them and gray
significant values were
parameters passed to us
when we were called 
by whom for what to where 
we did return, while within
father made a glass painting 
stage set, whatever shards 
reassembled resembled.
