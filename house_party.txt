not convinced by the names. Cadence feels meta, the others don't. why name them?

House Party

when my social meter is low
I call my friends May, Ann, Cadence           
and Joni and invite them to my house party.
I shower, change my bikini and wait 
for the bell. When the others arrive 
I'm already dancing it up in my gogo cage. 
Everyone talks about my dancing, but
to be honest, I am always terrible 
at parties. When the mime 
rolls in, or you hear the Mister Softee
truck, you know things are coming.
