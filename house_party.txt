House Party

Sometimes when my social meter is low
I call my friends May, Ann, Cadence
and Joni and invite them to my house party.
I shower, change my bikini and wait 
for the bell. When Morty and Barb arrive 
I'm already dancing it up in my gogo cage. 
Everyone is talking about my dancing. 
Our handsome robot butler is serving us
his romantic party energy drinks, thereby
multiplying all of our fun. To be honest, 
I am always terrible at parties. When the mime 
rolls in, or you hear the Mister Softee
truck, you know things are coming.
