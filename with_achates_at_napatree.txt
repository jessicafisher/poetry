With Achates at Napatree

All summer from Hector's roof we watched the library 
fire burn the small hours of morning. Your friends, 
you said, still remember you here, but Hector said
nothing, took another swig, sting of dregs on the way
down and flybitten legs hanging limp from the

	  drain pipe
	  refrigerator
	  square magnet
	  and ekphrasis
	  frieze, frame
	  with photo of
	  boy and dog
	  Tucker age 6
	  in his boat
	  brimmed cap 
	  and neon life 
	  preserver

At sunrise we walked the half mile to Napatree,
where the sandspit sits a broken scythe, a cut,
a vantage for seeking high masts. Hail, Achates:
what news of their biremes? The nape of pines
on the western ridge storm-splintered back in
	
	  1815 or '38
	  the anchorage
	  bottomed out
	  iron stove over-
	  grown, whence 
	  the old moniker
	  "the kitchen"
	  which shattered 
	  every glass-
	  like record: 
	  windspeed and
	  tidesurge
	  
No sign of them, no sign of king or boatswain,
waterlogged cargoes waving to shores. We combed 
the beach, scried empty beer cans on the sand.
Wreaths laid among jetsam and sacrifices made
to chipboard gods, we beat it, neque ignari malorum
