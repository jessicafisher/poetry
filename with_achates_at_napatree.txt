With Achates at Napatree

All summer from Hector's roof 
we watched the library fire burn 
the small hours of morning. Your friends, 
you said, still remember you here.
He said nothing, took another swig, 
sting of dregs on the way down 
and flybitten legs hanging limp 
from the drain pipe refrigerator, a magnet 
frieze of boy and dog, Tucker in boat
brimmed cap & preserver——

			At sunrise 
we walked the half mile to Napatree,
where the sandspit sits a broken scythe, 
a vantage for seeking high masts. Hail, Achates:
what news of their biremes? The nape of pines
on the western ridge storm-splintered back in
1815 or '38, the anchorage bottomed out,
which shattered every glass-
like record, windspeed and tidesurge.
	  
No sign of them, king or boatswain,
waterlogged cargoes waving to shores. We combed 
the beach, scried empty cans on the sand.
Wreaths laid among jetsam for chipboard gods, 
we beat it, knowing misfortune——

all the boats brought back to sea (brisk 
our vessels of habitation
