Nine Tile Pool Area

The original way is 
to make yourself
go swimming, then
remove the ladder.
When your energy 
icon pulses red,
Death antialiases
by the mailbox,
a cloud of skulls.
Fast forward through
a series of laggy
animations until
he comes around
to the backyard.
We're all chanting 
his name from the water
and he modestly 
unequips his dread
mantle, launches
himself in the nude 
from the diving board, 
rudely splashing us
with his cannonball.
