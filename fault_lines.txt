Fault Lines

You miss the turn for the museum
the day you say not like that
anyway and all at once it's my turn
to say something and I say something
about how two months from now I'll sit
hands folded in my lap, bullet
train moving three hundred mph
out of Tokyo towards somewhere
like home. These are the tracks
that carry me lifting each car
over the cracks in the earth.
This is the way the conductor 
smiles when he takes my ticket 
because he knows that I know 
this impossible train is the last 
hermetically sealed place on the planet
and as soon as my car door opens
everyone can tell all the quiet
air will be shot right out.
