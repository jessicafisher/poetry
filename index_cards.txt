Let's extend a region, a discourse forward
to the plane of the ear. Any set of three
points bounds, or binds; some surface.
1) I couldn't help myself broadcasting
my face area to a sympathetic monitor.
2) Everywhere is filled with everything
and everyone also unable to help themselves
broadcasting to monitors or themselves
monitoring. 3) Who could blame our volumes?
But some did blame everyone for taking
up all the dimensions. They ran out.
Because the blame was discontinuous
at certain values the limit did not exist.

Then The Apocalypse finally showed up,
late but unstylish. Waiting for him
with the RSVP in our hands, we considered
cancelling that we might save ourselves
the embarrassment. But despite the projected
pomp, elaborate visuals, all there was was
a contour field, a lossy gradient fading
from no one in one direction to nothing
in the other, striated intensities of the same
between. The President explained the order
of magnitude separates ruins from ends
with helpful diagrams, but in performing
our hasty rescues we left behind key artifacts.

Along some disposition or placement
we rotated our viewport in hot pursuit
of the scene. As if to reward attention
the scene basically failed to keep time,
its leaving emptied the bounding sphere
that delights some individual flower.
If this was nobody's fault in particular
it was nobody's particular joy either.
The lack of means to reach a region
of memory, say, flower, does not mean
one does not exist. The region that is.
I broadcast this as a matter of fact,
a fact of matter, perhaps or mattering.
